            <h2>About Trojan Eyes</h2>
            <p>The purpose of creating an affordable Raspberry Pi-based dashcam for cars at GCU campus is to enhance vehicular security and assist in mitigating the rising carjacking incidents on campus. This project aims to provide students, faculty, and staff with a cost-effective solution for real-time monitoring, recording, and documenting any suspicious activities around their vehicles. The dashcam will function as both a deterrent against theft and a valuable source of evidence in the event of a crime, contributing to a safer campus environment. By leveraging open-source technology, the system will be scalable and customizable, ensuring accessibility for all members of the GCU community.</p>
