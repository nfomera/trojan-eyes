            <h2>About Trojan Eyes</h2>
            <p>Trojan Eyes is a groundbreaking dashcam system designed to enhance road safety through real-time monitoring and motion detection. Powered by a Raspberry Pi, this compact device provides continuous surveillance, activating only when motion is detected to ensure privacy and save storage. With built-in local storage integration, Trojan Eyes securely stores footage, allowing for a 1-week archive with automated deletion, making it ideal for accident prevention and evidence gathering. Our goal is to deliver an affordable, user-friendly dashcam solution that gives drivers peace of mind and helps reduce roadway incidents with advanced, accessible technology.</p>
